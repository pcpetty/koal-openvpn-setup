proto udp                    # Protocol (use udp for efficiency, tcp for reliability)
dev tun                      # TUN device (for routing)

# Certificates and Keys
ca ca.crt                    # Certificate Authority (CA) file
cert server.crt              # Server certificate file
key server.key               # Server private key file (keep this secure)

# VPN Subnet
server 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0   # Internal VPN subnet (change as needed)

# Client IP Management
ifconfig-pool-persist ipp.txt   # Persistent IP allocation for clients

# Push Configuration to Clients
push "redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp"    # Route all client traffic through the VPN
push "dhcp-option DNS 8.8.8.8"              # Primary DNS (e.g., Google DNS)
push "dhcp-option DNS 8.8.4.4"              # Secondary DNS (e.g., Google DNS)

# Security Settings
keepalive 10 120               # Ping clients every 10s; consider them down after 120s
tls-auth ta.key 0              # HMAC signature for additional DoS protection (requires `ta.key`)
cipher AES-256-CBC             # Encryption cipher (ensure it matches client configuration)
auth SHA256                    # Message authentication code
user nobody                    # Drop privileges to user 'nobody'

# Logging and Verbosity
status openvpn-status.log      # Status log file
log-append /var/log/openvpn.log   # General log file
verb 3                         # Verbosity level (3 is recommended for normal use)

# Client Certificate Revocation (optional)
crl-verify crl.pem             # Certificate Revocation List (for revoking client access)

# Compression (optional)
# compress lz4                 # Use LZ4 compression (must match client if enabled)

# Additional Security Settings (optional)
# tls-version-min 1.2          # Minimum TLS version for stronger security
# tls-cipher TLS-DHE-RSA-WITH-AES-256-GCM-SHA384   # Specify a TLS cipher suite
