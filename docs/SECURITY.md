# Security Considerations for OpenVPN Server

This document outlines essential security practices for deploying and maintaining an OpenVPN server. Following these guidelines will help safeguard your VPN server and protect your data from unauthorized access.

## 1. Secure the Certificate Authority (CA) Key

The CA key is essential for generating client and server certificates, and if compromised, it could allow unauthorized users to create their own certificates. 

- **Store the CA key offline**: Only keep the CA key on a secure, offline machine. Transfer the certificates to the VPN server only when needed.
- **Limit CA key access**: Only trusted administrators should have access to the CA key. Use strong permissions to protect this file (`chmod 600 ca.key`).

## 2. Use Strong Encryption and Authentication

Encryption settings are critical to ensuring secure VPN communications. OpenVPN allows for strong encryption algorithms that protect data from interception.

- **Use AES-256-CBC encryption**: This is a widely recommended cipher for its balance between security and performance. To enable, set `cipher AES-256-CBC` in both `server.conf` and client configuration files.
- **Enable HMAC Authentication**: Adding a `tls-auth` key helps protect against DoS and brute-force attacks. Generate a `ta.key` file and include `tls-auth ta.key 0` in the server configuration.
- **Set the `auth` parameter**: Use SHA256 or higher (`auth SHA256`) for message authentication in the configuration files.

## 3. Implement Client Certificate Revocation List (CRL)

To manage and revoke certificates if a client key is compromised, implement a Certificate Revocation List (CRL).

- **Generate a CRL**: Use Easy-RSA to create a CRL, and store it securely in `/etc/openvpn/crl.pem`.
- **Add CRL to Server Configuration**: Update `server.conf` with `crl-verify /etc/openvpn/crl.pem` to check for revoked certificates.

To revoke a client certificate:
```bash
cd ~/openvpn-ca
./easyrsa revoke <client_name>
./easyrsa gen-crl
```

### Key Sections in SECURITY.md

1. **CA Key Security**: Emphasizes protection of the CA key, detailing offline storage and permissions.
2. **Encryption and Authentication**: Instructs on enabling strong encryption (AES-256) and HMAC for data integrity.
3. **CRL Management**: Guides users to revoke compromised client certificates.
4. **Firewall Configuration**: Ensures access control by restricting traffic to the OpenVPN server.
5. **Client Authentication**: Enforces dual authentication for improved security.
6. **Logging and Monitoring**: Advises on monitoring server logs for potential security issues.
7. **Regular Updates**: Stresses importance of keeping OpenVPN and system packages updated.
8. **Fail2Ban Setup**: Protects from brute-force attacks by monitoring OpenVPN logs.
9. **VPN Kill Switch**: Ensures traffic remains secure even if the VPN connection drops.
